# Legacy Siri

This bot is named Legacy Siri after Apple's virtual assistant. The bot was made with help from Moo#2899, WizardZombie#0001 and Nullpixel, each of which helped me to work towards the final product, which was finicky to code, but works well, and works simply.

This bot requires: 

- discord.py module version 1.0 
- Python 3.5.3 or higher

This bot does a few things:

- A simple command to text phrase process (used here to post a direct imgur link)
- A humourous error handling system, based around Siri itself

I hope this code inspires you or helps you solve any issues you may be having! Contact me on discord if you have any questions: @23 Aaron#0023
