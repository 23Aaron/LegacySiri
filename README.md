# Legacy Siri

This bot is named Legacy Siri after Apple's virtual assistant. The bot was made with help from [@TwoOneOink](https://twitter.com/TwoOneOink), WizardZombie and [Jamie Bishop](https://twitter.com/jamiebishop123), each of whom helped me to work towards the final product, which was finicky to code, but works well, and works simply.

This bot requires: 

- discord.py module version 1.0 or higher
- Python 3.5.3 or higher

This bot does a few things:

- A simple command to text phrase process (used here to post a direct imgur link)
- A humourous error handling system, based around Siri itself

I hope this code inspires you or helps you solve any issues you may be having! Contact me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/23aaron_) if you have any questions!
